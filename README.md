## Requirements

- PHP 8.3+
- MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.3+
- Apache with mod_rewrite (or Nginx with equivalent config)

### Required PHP extensions

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `pdo` + `pdo_mysql` | Database connectivity |
| `gd` | Image resizing, resampling, EXIF stripping |
| `fileinfo` | MIME type detection for uploads |
| `mbstring` | Multibyte / UTF-8 string handling |
| `json` | API responses and file-based cache (bundled in PHP 8) |
| `session` | User session management (bundled) |
| `filter` | Email validation / input sanitisation (bundled) |
| `hash` | Password hashing, CSRF tokens, SHA-256 deduplication (bundled) |
| `pcre` | Regular expressions (bundled) |

> **Note:** Extensions marked *bundled* are compiled into PHP by default on most distributions and do not need a separate install step.

### Recommended PHP extensions

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `iconv` | Fallback multibyte helpers when `mbstring` is unavailable (usually bundled) |
| `opcache` | Bytecode cache for better performance |

### Optional external tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ffmpeg` / `ffprobe` | Video thumbnail generation and metadata stripping |

### Installing extensions (Debian / Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt install php8.3-pdo php8.3-mysql php8.3-gd php8.3-mbstring php8.3-fileinfo
# Restart your web server after installing:
sudo systemctl restart apache2   # or nginx
```

### Installing extensions (RHEL / CentOS / AlmaLinux)

```bash
sudo dnf install php-pdo php-mysqlnd php-gd php-mbstring php-fileinfo
sudo systemctl restart php-fpm
```

## Installation

1. **Clone / extract** the project into your web server's document root (e.g. `/var/www/html/SocialWeb`)

2. **Create the database**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE socialweb CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
   CREATE USER 'socialweb_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON socialweb.* TO 'socialweb_user'@'localhost';
   ```

3. **Configure the application** — copy and edit:
   ```bash
   cp core/config.php core/config.local.php
   # Edit core/config.local.php with your DB credentials and SITE_URL
   ```

4. **Set ownership and permissions** — the web server must be able to write to
   `cache/`, `uploads/`, and `database/migrations/` (PHP deletes migration files
   after applying them).  Run the following as root, replacing `www` with the
   user your web server runs as (`www-data` on Debian/Ubuntu, `apache` on
   RHEL/CentOS):
   ```bash
   # Transfer ownership of writable directories to the web-server user
   sudo chown -R www:www cache/ uploads/ database/migrations/

   # Set directory permissions
   sudo chmod -R 755 cache/ database/migrations/
   sudo chmod -R 755 uploads/
   ```

   > **Tip:** On subsequent deployments use the included `deploy.sh` script
   > (see [Deployment](#deployment) below), which runs `git pull` and resets
   > permissions in one step.

5. **Run the setup wizard** — visit `http://yoursite/setup.php` in your browser to:
   - Create the database tables
   - Create the first admin user
   - Generate the first invite code

6. **Delete setup.php** after installation is complete.

7. **Invite users** — log in as admin, go to Admin → Invites, generate invite codes and share them.

## Security

- All user input is sanitised and validated via `RequestValidator` or dedicated helpers
- All database queries use prepared statements
- CSRF tokens on all forms
- Passwords hashed with `password_hash()` (bcrypt)
- Session fixation protection (`session_regenerate_id()`)
- Security headers: CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- Rate limiting on login and registration
- Media: MIME type validated with `finfo`, EXIF stripped via GD re-encoding
- Uploads directory protected by `.htaccess`
- HTML sanitiser (`sanitise_html()`) uses a DOM-based whitelist approach; distinguishes internal links (relative paths and same-host absolute URLs) from external links — only external links receive `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"`
- `linkify()` applies the same internal/external distinction when converting plain-text URLs to clickable links
- Security logic is split into focused sub-modules under `core/security/`: `csrf.php`, `headers.php`, `rate_limiter.php`, `sanitizer.php`, `session.php`

## Blog

Each user has a personal blog accessible from their profile page.

### Features

- **Rich-text editor** — Formatting toolbar supports bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, headings (H2/H3), ordered/unordered lists, blockquotes, and hyperlink insertion
- **Image uploads** — Insert images via drag-and-drop or the toolbar button; images are EXIF-stripped and resized server-side, then stored in a dedicated *Blog* gallery album
- **Comments** — Readers can leave comments on blog posts; authors and admins can delete comments
- **Likes** — Blog posts can be liked; likes generate a notification for the post author
- **Activity-feed integration** — Publishing a new post creates a wall entry of type `blog_post` so it appears in the news feed for followers
- **Edit & delete** — Authors can edit or soft-delete their own posts; admins can delete any post
- **Pagination** — Posts are listed newest-first, 10 per page

### Accessing the blog

| URL | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `/pages/blog.php` | Your own blog (defaults to the logged-in user) |
| `/pages/blog.php?user_id=N` | Blog of user with ID *N* |
| `/pages/blog.php?user_id=N&page=P` | Page *P* of user *N*'s blog |

A **View Blog** button also appears on every user profile page.

### Database schema

The blog uses the `blog_posts` table created by migration `009_add_blog.sql`:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `INT UNSIGNED` | Primary key |
| `user_id` | `INT UNSIGNED` | Author |
| `title` | `VARCHAR(255)` | Post title |
| `content` | `MEDIUMTEXT` | Sanitised HTML content |

## Forum

A threaded discussion board accessible from the main navigation.

### Features

- **Categories & forums** — Admins organise forums into top-level categories; each category holds one or more named forums
- **Threads & replies** — Logged-in users can start new threads and post replies; posts are written in a **rich-text editor** (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, lists, blockquotes, hyperlinks); legacy plain-text posts are auto-linked and rendered with smiley conversion
- **Thread locking** — Admins can lock threads to prevent further replies (🔒 icon shown)
- **Unread tracking** — The forum index displays an unread counter (🔵) per forum; threads are automatically marked as read when opened
- **Edit & delete** — Post authors and admins can edit or soft-delete threads and individual posts; edited posts show an "(edited)" indicator and timestamp
- **Image attachments** — Users can attach an image from their gallery to any post
- **Pagination** — Thread lists and post lists are paginated (20 items per page)

- **Image sharing** — Users can send inline images alongside text messages
- **Unread counters** — The navigation bar badge counts unread chat messages independently of private-message unread counts
- **Activity tracking** — The `chat_activity` table records the last time each user was active in chat, enabling "online" indicators

### Accessing chat

| URL | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `/chat/` | Chat inbox — list of all active conversations |
| `/chat/?user_id=N` | Open (or start) a conversation with user *N* |

## Gallery

A full-featured media gallery for photos and videos.

### Features

- **Categories** — Each user's gallery is organised into categories (e.g. "Main", "Travel"); albums live inside categories
- **Albums** — Users create named albums with optional descriptions and cover images; albums can be moved between categories
- **Multi-upload** — Drag-and-drop or file-picker upload of multiple images or videos in one batch
- **Lightbox** — Click any photo or video thumbnail to open a full-screen lightbox; supports keyboard navigation (← →, Esc) and closing by clicking the overlay
- **Likes & comments in lightbox** — The lightbox panel shows a per-media like button and live comment thread without leaving the page
- **Masonry layout** — Photos are displayed in a responsive masonry grid
- **Progressive loading** — Images are loaded lazily as they scroll into view via `IntersectionObserver`
- **Album mosaic** — When photos are uploaded, a 2×2 mosaic composite thumbnail is generated automatically and used as the wall-feed preview
- **SHA256 deduplication** — Duplicate uploads are detected by file hash; the existing record is reused instead of storing the file twice

### Accessing the gallery

| URL | Description |

| `/pages/gallery.php?user_id=N&album=A` | Album *A* of user *N* |

## Videos

A community-wide video hub for uploading and watching videos.

### Features

- **Upload** — Videos (MP4, WebM, OGG) are accepted; thumbnails are generated via `ffmpeg` if available, otherwise a placeholder is used
- **Description** — Each video has an optional caption/description that the owner can edit
- **Community grid** — All community videos are shown in a grid on the Videos page with thumbnails and titles
- **Playback page** — Each video has its own page for full-screen playback, description display, and owner management (edit description, delete)
- **Feed integration** — Uploading videos through an album triggers an `album_upload` wall post, keeping the news feed up to date

### Accessing videos

| URL | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `/pages/video.php` | Community video hub |
| `/pages/video_play.php?id=N` | Play video with ID *N* |

## Members Directory

A paginated, searchable directory of all registered members.

| URL | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `/pages/members.php` | Members list (first page) |
| `/pages/members.php?search=alice` | Search members by username or name |
| `/pages/members.php?page=N` | Page *N* of results |

## Admin Panel

The admin panel is accessible at `/admin/` and is restricted to users with the `admin` role.

### Pages

| URL | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `/admin/dashboard.php` | Overview statistics |
| `/admin/users.php` | Ban, unban, promote, or delete users |
| `/admin/invites.php` | Generate and manage invite codes |
| `/admin/moderation.php` | Review and remove flagged content |
| `/admin/media.php` | Browse and delete uploaded media |
| `/admin/settings.php` | Site banner, description, colour theme, custom fonts |
| `/admin/orphans.php` | Scan uploads for unreferenced files and delete them |
| `/admin/forum/` | Forum administration (categories, forums, moderation) |

### Site settings

- **Banner image** — Upload a JPEG/PNG/WebP banner shown at the top of every page
- **Site description** — Short tagline displayed in the header
- **Colour theme** — Choose one of six built-in dark themes: `blue-red`, `gray-orange`, `purple-red`, `green-teal`, `dark-gold`, `navy-cyan`
- **Custom fonts** — Upload WOFF2/WOFF/TTF/OTF fonts to replace the default system-font stack

### Orphan cleanup

`/admin/orphans.php` scans `uploads/` and cross-references every file against the database (media records, user avatars, album covers, chat images, site banner, and custom fonts). Files with no database reference are listed and can be bulk-deleted to reclaim disk space.

## Architecture

SocialWeb uses a modular flat-file architecture — no framework, no Composer dependencies.

### Module layout

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `core/security/` | `csrf.php`, `headers.php`, `rate_limiter.php`, `sanitizer.php`, `session.php` |
| `core/media/` | `image_processor.php`, `video_processor.php` |
| `includes/functions/` | `cache.php`, `media.php`, `notifications.php`, `pagination.php`, `theme.php` |
| `core/security.php` | Loader — `require_once`s all security sub-modules |
| `core/media_processor.php` | Loader — shared helpers + loads media sub-modules |
| `includes/functions.php` | Loader — loads all function sub-modules |

### RequestValidator

`core/RequestValidator.php` provides a centralised, type-safe way to extract and coerce HTTP request parameters instead of calling `sanitise_int()`, `sanitise_string()`, etc. ad-hoc across pages:

```php
$v     = new RequestValidator($_GET);
$id    = $v->int('id');            // unsigned int, default 0
$page  = $v->int('page', 1);       // with custom default
$name  = $v->string('name', 50);   // trimmed/stripped, max 50 chars
$email = $v->email('email');       // validated email or ''
$q     = $v->raw('q');             // raw string for downstream sanitisation
```

### Compat layer

`core/compat.php` provides lightweight polyfills for `mb_substr`, `mb_strlen`, `mb_strtolower`, `mb_strtoupper`, and `mb_convert_encoding` using `iconv` (when available) or byte-string functions as a last resort, so the application degrades gracefully on servers without the `mbstring` extension.

### Router

`core/router.php` provides a minimal front-controller with `route()` / `dispatch()` helpers used by AJAX endpoints. Routes support `{param}` placeholders that are injected into `$_GET` on match.

## Deployment

When pulling updates to a running server, use the included `deploy.sh` script
instead of running `sudo git pull` on its own.  Running `git pull` as root
leaves all newly-added files (including migration scripts) owned by `root`, so
the web server process cannot delete them after applying migrations, resulting
in *permission denied* errors.

`deploy.sh` pulls the latest code **and** resets ownership and permissions on
all writable directories in a single step:

```bash
# Default web-server user is 'www'.  Override with WEB_USER= if needed.
sudo bash deploy.sh

# Debian / Ubuntu (web-server user is www-data):
sudo WEB_USER=www-data bash deploy.sh

# RHEL / CentOS / AlmaLinux (web-server user is apache):
sudo WEB_USER=apache bash deploy.sh
```

After the script completes, visit `http://yoursite/upgrade.php` (or run
`php upgrade.php` from the CLI) to apply any pending database migrations.

> **Why only those three directories?**  Only `cache/`, `uploads/`, and
> `database/migrations/` need web-server write access.  Source files (PHP,
> CSS, JS) are owned by the deployment user and are read-only to the web
> server, which limits the damage if the application is ever compromised.

## Upgrading

When deploying a new version, apply any pending database migrations using the built-in migration runner:

1. Deploy the new files to your server using `deploy.sh` (see [Deployment](#deployment)), which resets file ownership so PHP can delete migration files after applying them.
2. Log in as an admin and visit `http://yoursite/upgrade.php` in your browser, **or** run it from the CLI:
   ```bash
   php upgrade.php
   ```
3. Click **Apply Migrations** to run all pending SQL scripts from `database/migrations/`.
4. **Delete or restrict access to `upgrade.php`** once all migrations have been applied.

> Migrations are tracked in the `db_migrations` table and are never applied twice.

## Plugin Development

Create a directory in `/plugins/my_plugin/` containing `plugin.php`:

```php
<?php
function plugin_register_my_plugin(array &$registry): void
{
    // Sidebar widget — rendered in the right-hand sidebar on every page
    $registry['sidebar_widgets'][] = function () {
        echo '<div class="widget"><h3 class="widget-title">My Widget</h3></div>';
    };

    // Wall widget — rendered inside the news-feed / wall page
    $registry['wall_widgets'][] = function () {
        echo '<div class="widget"><p>Wall content here.</p></div>';
    };

    // Menu item — appended to the main navigation bar
    $registry['menu_items'][] = [
        'label' => '🔗 My Page',
        'url'   => SITE_URL . '/pages/my_page.php',
    ];

    // Profile extension — rendered on user profile pages; receives the profile user's ID
    $registry['profile_extensions'][] = function (int $userId) {
        echo '<div class="widget"><p>Extra info for user ' . (int)$userId . '</p></div>';
    };
}
```

### Plugin hook summary

| Hook | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `sidebar_widgets` | `callable` | Rendered in the sidebar on every page |
